        <h4>Summer 2013</h4>
        <p>Machine Learning is that area of Artificial Intelligence that is concerned with computational artifacts that modify and improve their performance through experience. The area is concerned with issues both theoretical and practical. We will cover a variety of topics, including: statistical supervised and unsupervised learning methods, randomized search algorithms, Bayesian learning methods, and reinforcement learning. The course also covers theoretical concepts such as inductive bias, the PAC and Mistake-bound learning frameworks, minimum description length principle, and Occam's Razor. In order to ground these methods the course includes some programming and involvement in a number of projects.</p>
        <h4>Instructor</h4>
        <p>Pushkar Kolhe, Jonathan Scholz<br />271A, College of Computing Building</p>
        <p>Office Hours: Wed, Fri 3-4 pm</p>
        <p>Contact: pushkar@gatech.edu, jkscholz@gatech.edu, cs4641@cc.gatech.edu (to reach both instructors)</p>
        <h4>Lectures</h4>
        <p>Klaus 1443 Tue, Thur 12-1:45 pm</p>
        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <p>These are the primary objectives of this course:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To learn how to think like a data scientist.</li>
          <li>To build intelligent applications that analyze and predict data.</li>
          <li>To develop the basic skills necessary to pursue research in ML.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Almost all of Machine Learning applications today require you to think like a researcher. So the last objective will be the core of this course.</p>
        <h4>Prerequisities</h4>
        <p>CS 3600 or Introduction to Artificial Intelligence or Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun's AI class on <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs271">Udacity</a>. Apart from this the class will allow you to learn and go as far as you are interested to. If you are interested in pursuing a research topic or another project, talk to me and I will get you in touch with the reading material you need to know.</p>
        <h4><a href="reading.php">Course Materials</a></h4>
        
        <h4>Grading</h4>
        <p>Your grade will be divided into four components: assignments, a group project, midterm and final exam.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Assignments:</b> You will have three assignments which will help you to understand how each algorithm that we learn can assist you to analyze data. The last assignment will be on Kaggle where you will compete with your classmates on a data challenge.</li>
        <li><b>Group Projects:</b> You will use the project to pursue a topic of your interest in Machine Learning. If you can't figure out a cool project, I will get you started on a seriously cool project.</li>
        <li><b>Midterm and Final Exam:</b> These will be closed book exams.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Numbers</b>: 
        <br />Assignments 50%
        <br />Midterm 25%
        <br />Final 25%</p>
        <h4>Statement of Academic Honesty</h4>
        <p>Your aim should not be to ace the course, but learn as much as you can. Be honest in solving your assignments and exams and you will learn and enjoy the material. You are all adults, more or less, and are expected to follow the university's code of academic conduct (you know, <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/honor/">the honor code</a>). Furthermore, at least some of you are researchers-in-training, and I expect that you understand proper attribution and the importance of intellectual honesty. I also have several... friends... from Texas who will help me personally deal with you.</p>
        <h4>Due Dates</h4>
        <p>All graded assignments are due by the time and date indicated. I will not accept late assignments or make up exams. You will get zero credit for any late assignment. If a meteor landed on your bed and destroyed your assignment, I need a signed note from the meteor. You should also treat assigned readings as, well, assignments that are due at the beginning of each class.</p>
